## My Thoughts 💡

I want to learn more about React and created this simple project to do so. I used only official documentation, Google, and avoided any video tutorials. I'm always looking to learn and improve – please feel free to raise PRs and/or provide any feedback you believe would help. At the very least, I hope you learn a new word or two. 😉  

Thank you! 🙏🏻
